# DS_Tourism_Experience_Analytics
 Project Description

Tourism Experience Analytics is an end-to-end machine learning project focused on enhancing tourism platforms using data. This project predicts attraction ratings, classifies visit modes (e.g., Family, Business), and recommends tourist spots tailored to user preferences — all deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit app.

 Key Objectives
 
    Regression – Predict how a user might rate a tourist attraction.
    Classification – Predict user visit mode: Business, Family, Couples, or Friends.
    Recommendation System – Recommend attractions based on user demographics and travel history.

 Business Use Cases
 
    Personalized travel recommendations
    Analytics on tourist behavior and hotspots
    Targeted marketing & user segmentation
    Improved customer retention through personalization
